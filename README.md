# lab4_RegressionAnalysis_MSCS-634-B01

## Overview

This repository contains the work and analysis for Lab 4 of MSCS-634-B01, focusing on Regression Analysis using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Purpose of the Lab

The primary purpose of this lab is to provide hands-on experience with regression analysis techniques. Through practical application, the lab aims to deepen understanding of fitting regression models, interpreting results, and evaluating model effectiveness on real-world or synthetic datasets.

## Key Insights Gained

- **Understanding Regression Fundamentals:** Developed a foundational understanding of simple and multiple linear regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Gained experience evaluating regression models using metrics such as RÂ², residuals analysis, and significance testing.
- **Feature Selection and Interpretation:** Learned the impact of different variables on the prediction outcome and how to interpret coefficients.
- **Visualization Skills:** Enhanced data visualization skills to illustrate regression lines, residuals, and model fit.

## Challenges Faced and Decisions Made

- **Data Preprocessing:** Faced challenges with missing or inconsistent data, which required careful cleaning and preprocessing decisions.
- **Model Selection:** Had to decide between simple and multiple regression approaches based on data characteristics.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting:** Encountered issues balancing model complexity to avoid overfitting or underfitting, leading to trial and error with feature selection.
- **Interpretation:** Interpreting statistical outputs and ensuring correct understanding of p-values and confidence intervals was initially challenging, but improved with practice.

## Repository Structure

- All code and analysis are provided in Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`).

## Language

- 100% Jupyter Notebook
